## 🧠 What is a Module in Python?

👉 A **module** is just a **file** with Python code that you can **use in other files**.

---

## 📦 Why Use Modules?

* To **organize** your code (like putting things in folders)
* To **reuse** code (don’t copy-paste)
* To make your code **clean and simple**

---

## 📁 Example: Your Own Module

### Step 1: Create a file called `helper.py`

```python
# helper.py
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

### Step 2: Create another file called `main.py`

```python
# main.py
import helper

helper.say_hello("Aitbubu")
```

✅ When you run `main.py`, it will print:

```
Hello, Aitbubu!
```

## 🧰 You Can Also Use Python's Built-In Modules

Example: use the **math** module

```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
```

## 🕓 When to Use Modules?

| Situation                           | Use Module? |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Your code is long                   | ✅ Yes       |
| You want to reuse code later        | ✅ Yes       |
| You work with others                | ✅ Yes       |
| Just writing a small 10-line script | ❌ No need   |

---

## 🎯 Summary

* A **module = one `.py` file**
* You **import** it to use functions from it
* It helps you **stay organized and reuse code**
