## üß† What Are Built-in Modules?

Built-in modules are **ready-made tools** in Python that help you do common tasks like:

* Math
* Random numbers
* Working with dates and time
* File handling
* System operations

## üì¶ Examples of Built-in Modules

Here are some **popular built-in modules**:

| Module     | What it does                                    | Example use case                            |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `math`     | Math functions (square root, pi, sin, etc.)     | Calculate square roots or use `pi`          |
| `random`   | Work with random numbers                        | Pick a random item from a list              |
| `datetime` | Work with dates and time                        | Get today‚Äôs date or current time            |
| `os`       | Talk to your computer‚Äôs file system             | Create folders, delete files                |
| `sys`      | Info about Python itself or system arguments    | Access command-line arguments               |
| `time`     | Work with time (wait, measure time)             | Delay execution, measure how long code runs |
| `json`     | Read/write JSON (data format like a dictionary) | Save settings, work with web data           |

## üß™ How to Use Them

You just need to **import** the module, like this:

```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(9))  # Output: 3.0
print(math.pi)       # Output: 3.1415...
```

Or import just part of it:

```python
from math import sqrt

print(sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0
```

## ‚ú® Real-Life Examples

### üé≤ `random` ‚Äî Pick a random student

```python
import random

students = ["Ali", "Aitbubu", "Sara"]
print(random.choice(students))
```

---

### üìÜ `datetime` ‚Äî Print today‚Äôs date

```python
import datetime

today = datetime.date.today()
print("Today is:", today)
```

---

### üïí `time` ‚Äî Wait for 3 seconds

```python
import time

print("Wait for it...")
time.sleep(3)
print("Done!")
```

---

### üìÅ `os` ‚Äî Make a new folder

```python
import os

os.mkdir("new_folder")
```
